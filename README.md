# ClientCentricConsistencyProject
This project simulates a distributed banking system that assumes a single customer interacting with multiple servers. It is implemented using gRPC and Python.

The primary objective of this project is to enforce the Read-Your-Writes policy, a key aspect of Client-Centric Consistency in distributed systems.
